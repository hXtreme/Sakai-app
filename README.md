# Sakai-app

A Sakai app that works for me.

The design goal of the app is to have a simplistic material UI that allows you to focus on important tasks.

This app will take heavy inspiration from the following projects for design, features and goals:
+ [Sakai Client Android](https://github.com/SChakravorti21/SakaiClientAndroid) - An amazing Sakai app that I personally feel lacking in the UI department.
+ [SakaiPy](https://github.com/willkara/SakaiPy) - A Python library that I aim to use as a learning tool while working with authenticating and requsting from Sakai.
