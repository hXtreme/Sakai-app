# Sakai-app

A Sakai app that works for me.

The design goal of the app is to have a simplistic material UI that allows you to focus on important tasks.

This app will take heavy inspiration from the following projects for design, features and goals:
+ [Sakai Client Android](https://github.com/SChakravorti21/SakaiClientAndroid) - An amazing Sakai app that I personally feel lacking in the UI department.
+ [SakaiPy](https://github.com/willkara/SakaiPy) - A Python library that I aim to use as a learning tool while working with authenticating and requsting from Sakai.

That said, any and all help is welcomed!


## Special Thanks to:
+ [inorichi](https://github.com/inorichi/) whose repo [tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi) 
was my basis of my development. Given that I started with almost no prior knowledge of android development or 
Kotlin, his repo was a great source of learning for me and, it would be no co-incident that my source would look 
similar to his own.
